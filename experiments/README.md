"sketchpad" experiment:

There are four categories containing eight objects each. 
The categories are: birds, chairs, cars, dogs. 

Objects were grouped into eight quartets:
Four of these quartets contained objects from the same category ("close");
the other four of these quartets contained objects from different categories ("far").

Each quartet was presented four times, such that each object in the quartet served as the target exactly once. 

On each trial, one quartet of objects shown. The sketcher's task was to make a sketch of the cued object such that the viewer could identify it from the quartet.
