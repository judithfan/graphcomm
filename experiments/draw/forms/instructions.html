<h2><center>Guess My Sketch!</center>  </h2>

	<p>

	  In this experiment you will play a fun communication game with
	  another player on MTurk! In each round both of you are going to be shown a set of objects like this:
</p>
    <p>
      <center><img src="images/chairset.png" alt="Example objects" style="width:700px;height:200px"></center>
    </p>
<p>
    You'll each see the same four objects <b> but the order they are in
	will be different. </b>

</p>

<p>

    One of you will be assigned the <b> Sketcher </b> role and the
    other will be the <b> Viewer </b>. On each round, one of the four
    objects is the <b>target</b>, which is outlined in orange. Only the
    Sketcher can see which object is
    the target.



</p>

<p>

    The goal of the Sketcher is to make a sketch of the target so
    that the Viewer can figure out which object it is. You'll both
    get <b> a bonus of $0.03 for each correct response</b>, so pay
    attention! If you are the Sketcher, please do your best to make a sketch of
    each target from the perspective that is shown in the picture. <b> Please
    do NOT draw text labels, arrows, or any background for the object.</b>

</p>

<!-- <p>
      <center><img src="images/speakerView.png" alt="Example gameplay" style="width:600px;height:328px"></center>
    </p>
<p>
  <i> <center> <small> Only the Sketcher can see which is the target. </small> </center> </i>

</p> -->
<p>
    The goal is for the Viewer to identify the target
    based on what the Sketcher has drawn. If you are the Viewer,
    you will first need to wait until the Sketcher has finished
    their sketch before making your selection.
</p>

    <p> Once the Viewer clicks on
    the object they believe is the target, both players will be given
    feedback. So, the Sketcher will see what the Viewer clicked, and the
    Viewer will see the true target. Then you will both automatically advance to the next round of objects. There are a
    total of <b>32 rounds</b>. After the final round you will fill out a quick
    15 second survey and be on your way.
</p>

<p> A few final notes: First, since you are playing with another
  player, you may see this screen before the game begins:
  <p>
    <center><img src="images/waitScreen.png" alt="initial matcher's board" style="width:700px;height:150px"></center>
  </p>
  Just hold tight. Another player should join the game within the next
  few minutes. If you're in the waiting room 15 minutes without
  another player joining, please return the HIT and try again later!
</p>

<p>
  Second, please be respectful of the worker you're playing with: do
  not send inappropriate material to your partner (e.g.,
  words), and try to be as responsive as possible.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, please DO NOT refresh the page at any point once you start
  the game (including the waiting page). If you refresh, you will not
  be able to rejoin the game you were in and you may not be able to
  submit the HIT. <br> Thank you!
</p>
